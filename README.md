# landing-page
Simple landing page project

Completely understood why some things behave with flex how they behave.
Had a problem with divs pushing eachother out of the page, banged my head about it for a good few hours,re-reading my code time after time to finally understand that I used the false justify-content for my HTML layout, because every single section on the page has it's own container and then a wrapper because of the background color.
Had a lot of fun and frustration but glad I could code the exact page example from the photo I got from The Odin Project
